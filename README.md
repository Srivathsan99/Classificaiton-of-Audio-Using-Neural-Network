# Classificaiton-of-Audio-Using-Neural-Network

•	This project was done working with audio files using librosa instead of scipy.<br>
•	Librosa uses mono audio sample conversion by default in 22050 Hz instead of scipy’s 11025Hz.<br>
•	Using librosa feature.mfcc (mel frequency cepstral coefficients) we can summarize the frequency distribution.<br>
•	MFCC helps us in analyzing the frequency and time characteristics of the source audio.<br>
•	Sequential model built along with adam optimizer.<br>
•	Dropout (to prevent overfitting) and batch normalization were used on each layer.<br>
